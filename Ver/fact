                 NOTES, DEFINITIONS, AND ABBREVIATIONS

There have been some significant changes in this edition. The Trust
Territory of the Pacific Islands became the independent nation of
Palau. The gross domestic product (GDP) of all countries is now
presented on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis rather than on the
old exchange rate basis. There is a new entry on Age structure and the
Airports entry now includes unpaved runways. The Communications
category has been restructured and now includes the entries of
Telephone system, Radio, and Television. The remainder of the entries
in the former Communications category-Railroads, Highways, Inland
waterways, Pipelines, Ports, Merchant marine, and Airports-can now be
found under a new category called Transportation. There is a new
appendix listing estimates of gross domestic product on an exchange
rate basis for all nations. A reference map of the Republic of South
Africa is included. The electronic files used to produce the Factbook
have been restructured into a database. As a result, the formats of
some entries in this edition have been changed. Additional changes
will occur in the 1996 Factbook.

Administrative divisions: The numbers, designatory terms, and
first-order administrative divisions are generally those approved by
the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been
reported but not yet acted on by BGN are noted.

Airports: Only airports with usable runways are included in this
listing. For airports with more than one runway, only the longest
runway is included. Not all airports have facilities for refueling,
maintenance, or air traffic control. Paved runways have concrete or
asphalt surfaces; unpaved runways have grass, dirt, sand, or gravel
surfaces.

Area: Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited by
international boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the aggregate
of all surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or
coastlines, excluding inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).
Comparative areas are based on total area equivalents. Most entities
are compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states. The smaller
entities are compared with Washington, DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The
Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).

Birth rate: The average annual number of births during a year per
1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude birth rate. Dates of
information: In general, information available as of 1 January 1995 is
used in the preparation of this edition. Population figures are
estimates for 1 July 1995, with population growth rates estimated for
calendar year 1995. Major political events have been updated through
April 1995.

Death rate: The average annual number of deaths during a year per
l,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate.

Digraphs: The digraph is a two-letter "country code" that precisely
identifies every entity without overlap, duplication, or omission. AF,
for example, is the digraph for Afghanistan. It is a standardized
geopolitical data element promulgated in the Federal Information
Processing Standards Publication (FIPS) 10-3 by the National Bureau of
Standards (now called National Institute of Standards and Technology)
at the US Department of Commerce and maintained by the Office of the
Geographer at the US Department of State. The digraph is used to
eliminate confusion and incompatibility in the collection, processing,
and dissemination of area-specific data and is particularly useful for
interchanging data between databases.

Diplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic relations
with 184 nations, including 178 of the 185 UN members (excluded UN
members are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, former Yugoslavia,
and the US itself). In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with
6 nations that are not in the UN - Holy See, Kiribati, Nauru,
Switzerland, Tonga, and Tuvalu.

Economic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official
development assistance (ODA) and other official flows (OOF). ODA is
defined as financial assistance which is concessional in character,
has the main objective to promote economic development and welfare of
LDCs, and contains a grant element of at least 25%. OOF transactions
are also official government assistance, but with a main objective
other than development and with a grant element less than 25%. OOF
transactions include official export credits (such as Ex-Im Bank
credits), official equity and portfolio investment, and debt
reorganization by the official sector that does not meet concessional
terms. Aid is considered to have been committed when agreements are
initialed by the parties involved and constitute a formal declaration
of intent.

Entities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special
sovereignty, and governments included in this publication are not
independent, and others are not officially recognized by the US
Government. "Nation" refers to a people politically organized into a
sovereign state with a definite territory. "Dependent area" refers to
a broad category of political entities that are associated in some way
with a nation. Names used for page headings are usually the short-form
names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names. There are 266
entities in The World Factbook that may be categorized as follows:

Exchange rate:
The official value of a nation's monetary unit at a given date or over
a given period of time, as expressed in units of local currency per US
dollar and as determined by international market forces or official
fiat.

GDP methodology: In the "Economy" section, GDP dollar estimates for
all countries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP)
calculations rather than from conversions at official currency
exchange rates. The PPP method normally involves the use of
international dollar price weights, which are applied to the
quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy. In
addition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of countries,
the statistician faces a major difficulty in specifying, identifying,
and allowing for the quality of goods and services. The division of a
GDP estimate in local currency by the corresponding PPP estimate in
dollars gives the PPP conversion rate. On average, one thousand
dollars will buy the same market basket of goods in the US as one
thousand dollars - converted to the local currency at the PPP
conversion rate - will buy in the other country. Whereas PPP estimates
for OECD countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing
countries are often rough approximations. Most of the GDP estimates
are based on extrapolation of numbers published by the UN
International Comparison Program and by Professors Robert Summers and
Alan Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues.
Currency exchange rates depend on a variety of international and
domestic financial forces that often have little relation to domestic
output. In developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate
estimate of GDP in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the PPP
estimate. Furthermore, exchange rates may suddenly go up or down by
10% or more because of market forces or official fiat whereas real
output has remained unchanged. On 12 January 1994, for example, the 14
countries of the African Financial Community (whose currencies are
tied to the French franc) devalued their currencies by 50%. This move,
of course, did not cut the real output of these countries by half. One
important caution: the proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a
percentage of GDP in local currency accounts may differ substantially
from the proportion when GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as,
for example, when an observer tries to estimate the dollar level of
Russian or Japanese military expenditures. Note: The numbers for GDP
and other economic data can not be chained together from successive
volumes of the Factbook because of changes in the US dollar measuring
rod, revisions of data by statistical agencies, use of new or
different sources of information, and changes in national statistical
methods and practices.

Gross domestic product (GDP): The value of all final goods and
services produced within a nation in a given year.

Gross national product (GNP): The value of all final goods and
services produced within a nation in a given year, plus income earned
abroad, minus income earned by foreigners from domestic production.

Gross world product (GWP): The aggregate value of all goods and
services produced worldwide in a given year.

Growth rate (population): The annual percent change in the population,
resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the
balance of migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate may be
positive or negative.

Illicit drugs: There are five categories of illicit drugs - narcotics,
stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and cannabis.
These categories include many drugs legally produced and prescribed by
doctors as well as those illegally produced and sold outside medical
channels.
Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides
hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana
(pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC,
Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).
Coca (Erythroxylum coca) is a bush, and the leaves contain the
stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa,
which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa,
and cocoa butter.
Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.
Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and
include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,
phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone
(Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,
Valmid). Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical,
mental, emotional, or behavioral change in an individual. Drug abuse
is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that results in
physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an
individual. Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking,
self-awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid,
microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine
variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog),
phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin,
psilocyn).
Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant
(Cannabis sativa).
Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.
Mandrax is the Southwest Asian slang term for methaqualone, a
pharmaceutical depressant.
Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis
sativa).
Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, in slang referred to as
Quaaludes in North America or Mandrax in Southwest Asia Narcotics are
drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to opium, opium
derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics include
opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol),
codeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with codeine, Robitussan AC),
and thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin (horse, smack),
and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic narcotics include meperidine
or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose),
and others (Darvon, Lomotil).
Opium is the milky exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the opium
poppy. Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for many natural
and semisynthetic narcotics. Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid
derived from the mature dried opium poppy.
Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of catha edulis
that is chewed or drunk as tea.
Quaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone, a
pharmaceutical depressant.
Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and
activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines
(Desoxyn, Dexedrine), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate
(Ritalin), and others (Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).

Infant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one year
old in a given year per l,000 live births occurring in the same year.

International disputes: This category includes a wide variety of
situations that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to
unilateral claims of one sort or another. Information regarding
disputes over international boundaries and maritime boundaries has
been reviewed by the Department of State. References to other
situations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such
as resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues.
However, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance
or recognition by the US Government.

Irrigated land: The figure refers to the land area that is
artificially supplied with water.

Land use: The land surface is categorized as arable land - land
cultivated for crops that are replanted after each harvest (wheat,
maize, rice); permanent crops - land cultivated for crops that are not
replanted after each harvest (citrus, coffee, rubber); meadows and
pastures - land permanently used for herbaceous forage crops; forest
and woodland - under dense or open stands of trees; and other - any
land type not specifically mentioned above (urban areas, roads,
desert).

Leaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country who
represents the state at official and ceremonial functions but is not
involved with the day- to-day activities of the government. The head
of government is the administrative leader who manages the day-to-day
activities of the government. In the UK, the monarch is the chief of
state, and the Prime Minister is the head of government. In the US,
the President is both the chief of state and the head of government.

Life expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived by a
group of people all born in the same year, if mortality at each age
remains constant in the future.

Literacy: There are no universal definitions and standards of
literacy. Unless otherwise noted, all rates are based on the most
common definition - the ability to read and write at a specified age.
Detailing the standards that individual countries use to assess the
ability to read and write is beyond the scope of this publication.

Maritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some
national claims from being extended the full distance.

Merchant marine: All ships engaged in the carriage of goods. All
commercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which
excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc. Also, a
grouping of merchant ships by nationality or register.
Captive register - A register of ships maintained by a territory,
possession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships
owned in the parent country; also referred to as an offshore register,
the offshore equivalent of an internal register. Ships on a captive
register will fly the same flag as the parent country, or a local
variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation
rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a captive
register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent
country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned
abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience
register, except that it is not the register of an independent state.
Flag of convenience register - A national register offering
registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major
flags of convenience (FOC) attract ships to their registers by virtue
of low fees, low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal
manning requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by having
relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in the flag
state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a
given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority
of the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an
open register.
Flag state - The nation in which a ship is registered and which holds
legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or
abroad. Flag state maritime legislation determines how a ship is
manned and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the
register.
Internal register - A register of ships maintained as a subset of a
national register. Ships on the internal register fly the national
flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of
maritime rules from those on the main national register. These
differences usually include lower taxation of profits, manning by
foreign nationals, and, usually, ownership outside the flag state
(when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International
Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most
notable examples of an internal register. Both have been instrumental
in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and
in attracting foreign owned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags.
Merchant ship - A vessel that carries goods against payment of
freight; commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately
restricted to commercial vessels only.
Register - The record of a ship's ownership and nationality as listed
with the maritime authorities of a country; also, the compendium of
such individual ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides
it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of the country
in which registered (the flag state) regardless of the nationality of
the ship's ultimate owner.

Money figures: All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US
dollars unless otherwise indicated.

National product: The total output of goods and services in a country
in a given year. See GDP methodology, Gross domestic product (GDP),
and Gross national product (GNP).

Net migration rate: The balance between the number of persons entering
and leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on
midyear population). An excess of persons entering the country is
referred to as net immigration (3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an
excess of persons leaving the country as net emigration (-9.26
migrants/1,000 population).

Population: Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census based
on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics registration
systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past, and on
assumptions about future trends. Starting with the 1993 Factbook,
demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African) have taken
into account the effects of the growing incidence of AIDS infections;
in 1993 these countries were Burkina, Burundi, Central African
Republic, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania,
Uganda, Zaire, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Thailand, Brazil, and Haiti.

Telephone numbers: All telephone numbers presented in the Factbook
consist of the country code in brackets, the city or area code (where
required) in parentheses, and the local number. The one component that
is not presented is the international access code which varies from
country to country. For example, an international direct dial phone
call placed from the United States to Madrid, Spain, would be as
follows:

    011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx where
    011 is the international access code for station-to-station calls
    (01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls),
    [34] is the country code for Spain,
    (1) is the city code for Madrid,
    577 is the local exchange,
    and xxxx is the local telephone number.

An international direct dial phone call placed from another country to
the United States would be as follows:

international access code + [1] (202) 939-xxxx where
    [1] is the country code for the United States,
    (202) is the area code for Washington, DC,
    939 is the local exchange,
    and xxxx is the local telephone number.

Total fertility rate: The average number of children that would be
born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing
years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each
age. Years: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless
indicated as fiscal year (FY). FY93/94 refers to the fiscal year that
began in calendar year 1993 and ended in calendar year 1994 as defined
in the Fiscal Year entry of the Economy section for each nation.
FY90-94 refers to the four fiscal years that began in calendar year
1990 and ended in calendar year 1994.

Note: Information for the US and US dependencies was compiled from
material in the public domain and does not represent Intelligence
Community estimates. The Handbook of International Economic
Statistics, published annually in September by the Central
Intelligence Agency, contains detailed economic information for the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
countries, Eastern Europe, the newly independent republics of the
former nations of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, and selected other
countries. The Handbook can be obtained wherever The World Factbook is
available.

 to a two-year term by a national shura, later amended by multi-party
 agreement to 18 months; note - in June 1994 failure to agree on a

 continues in office head of government: Prime Minister of the Council
 of Ministers Aleksander Gabriel MEKSI (since 10 April 1992)

@Afghanistan:Economy

 Overview: Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked country, highly
 dependent on farming (wheat especially) and livestock raising (sheep
 and goats). Economic considerations have played second fiddle to
 political and military upheavals during more than 15 years of war,
 including the nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended
 15 February 1989). Over the past decade, one-third of the population
 fled the country, with Pakistan sheltering more than 3 million
 refugees and Iran about 3 million. About 1.4 million Afghan refugees
 remain in Pakistan and about 2 million in Iran. Another 1 million
 probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan.
 Although reliable data are unavailable, gross domestic product is
 lower than 13 years ago because of the loss of labor and capital and
 the disruption of trade and transport.

@Albania:Economy

 Overview: An extremely poor country by European standards, Albania is
 making the difficult transition to a more open-market economy. The
 economy rebounded in 1993-94 after a severe depression accompanying
 the collapse of the previous centrally planned system in 1990 and
 1991. Stabilization policies - including a strict monetary policy,
 public sector layoffs, and reduced social services - have improved the
 government's fiscal situation and reduced inflation. The recovery was
 spurred by the remittances of some 20% of the population which works
 abroad, mostly in Greece and Italy. These remittances supplement GDP
 and help offset the large foreign trade deficit. Foreign assistance
 and humanitarian aid also supported the recovery. Most agricultural
 land was privatized in 1992, substantially improving peasant incomes.
 Albania's limited industrial sector, now less than one-sixth of GDP,
 continued to decline in 1994. A sharp fall in chromium prices reduced
 hard currency receipts from the mining sector. Large segments of the
 population, especially those living in urban areas, continue to depend
 on humanitarian aid to meet basic food requirements. Unemployment
 remains a severe problem accounting for approximately one-fifth of the
 work force. Growth is expected to continue in 1995, but could falter
 if Albania becomes involved in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia,
 workers' remittances from Greece are reduced, or foreign assistance
 declines.

@Algeria:Economy

 Overview: The hydrocarbons sector is the backbone of the economy,
 accounting for roughly 57% of government revenues, 25% of GDP, and
 almost all export earnings; Algeria has the fifth largest reserves of
 natural gas in the world and ranks fourteenth for oil. Algiers'
 efforts to reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the
 Arab world began after the 1986 collapse of world oil prices plunged
 the country into a severe recession. In 1989, the government launched
 a comprehensive, IMF-supported program to achieve macroeconomic
 stabilization and to introduce market mechanisms into the economy.
 Despite substantial progress toward macroeconomic adjustment, in 1992
 the reform drive stalled as Algiers became embroiled in political
 turmoil. In September 1993, a new government was formed, and one
 priority was the resumption and acceleration of the structural
 adjustment process. Buffeted by the slump in world oil prices and
 burdened with a heavy foreign debt, Algiers concluded a one-year
 standby arrangement with the IMF in April 1994.

@Andorra:Economy

 Overview: Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's economy, accounts for
 roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 13 million tourists visit annually,
 attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter
 resorts. The banking sector, with its "tax haven" status, also
 contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is
 limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be
 imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising.
 Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.
 Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union; it is unclear what effect
 the European Single Market will have on the advantages Andorra obtains
 from its duty-free status.

@Angola:Government

 Note: Civil war has been the norm since independence from Portugal on
 11 November 1975; a cease-fire lasted from 31 May 1991 until October
 1992 when the insurgent National Union for the Total Independence of
 Angola (UNITA) refused to accept its defeat in internationally
 monitored elections and fighting resumed throughout much of the
 countryside. The two sides signed another peace accord on 20 November
 1994; the cease-fire is generally holding but most provisions of the
 accord remain to be implemented.

@Angola:Economy

 Overview: Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for
 80%-90% of the population but accounts for less than 15% of GDP. Oil
 production is vital to the economy, contributing about 60% to GDP.
 Despite the signing of a peace accord in November 1994 between the
 Angola government and the UNITA insurgents, sporadic fighting
 continues and many farmers remain reluctant to return to their fields.
 As a result, much of the country's food requirements must still be
 imported. Angola has rich natural resources - notably gold, diamonds,
 and arable land, in addition to large oil deposits - but will need to
 observe the cease-fire, implement the peace agreement, and reform
 government policies if it is to achieve its potential.

ANTARCTICA

@Antarctica:Geography

 Location: continent mostly south of the Antarctic Circle

 Map references: Antarctic Region

 Area:
 total area: 14 million sq km (est.)
 land area: 14 million sq km (est.)
 comparative area: slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US
 note: second-smallest continent (after Australia)

 Land boundaries: none, but see entry on International disputes

 Coastline: 17,968 km

 Maritime claims: none, but see entry on International Disputes

 International disputes: Antarctic Treaty defers claims (see Antarctic
 Treaty Summary below); sections (some overlapping) claimed by
 Argentina, Australia, Chile, France (Adelie Land), New Zealand (Ross
 Dependency), Norway (Queen Maud Land), and UK; the US and most other
 nations do not recognize the territorial claims of other nations and
 have made no claims themselves (the US reserves the right to do so);
 no formal claims have been made in the sector between 90 degrees west
 and 150 degrees west

 Climate: severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and
 distance from the ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West
 Antarctica because of its higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has
 the most moderate climate; higher temperatures occur in January along
 the coast and average slightly below freezing

 Terrain: about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock,
 with average elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain
 ranges up to 4,897 meters high; ice-free coastal areas include parts
 of southern Victoria Land, Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area,
 and parts of Ross Island on McMurdo Sound; glaciers form ice shelves
 along about half of the coastline, and floating ice shelves constitute
 11% of the area of the continent

 Natural resources: none presently exploited; iron ore, chromium,
 copper, gold, nickel, platinum and other minerals, and coal and
 hydrocarbons have been found in small, uncommercial quantities

 Land use:
 arable land: 0%
 permanent crops: 0%
 meadows and pastures: 0%
 forest and woodland: 0%
 other: 100% (ice 98%, barren rock 2%)

 Irrigated land: 0 sq km

 Environment:
 current issues: in October 1991 it was reported that the ozone shield,
 which protects the Earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation,
 had dwindled to the lowest level recorded over Antarctica since 1975
 when measurements were first taken
 natural hazards: katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward from
 the high interior; frequent blizzards form near the foot of the
 plateau; cyclonic storms form over the ocean and move clockwise along
 the coast; volcanism on Deception Island and isolated areas of West
 Antarctica; other seismic activity rare and weak
 international agreements: NA

 Note: the coldest, windiest, highest, and driest continent; during
 summer more solar radiation reaches the surface at the South Pole than
 is received at the Equator in an equivalent period; mostly
 uninhabitable

 Article 6: includes under the treaty all land and ice shelves south of
 60 degrees 00 minutes south
 Article 7: treaty-state observers have free access, including aerial
 observation, to any area and may inspect all stations, installations,
 and equipment; advance notice of all activities and of the
 introduction of military personnel must be given
 Article 8: allows for jurisdiction over observers and scientists by
 their own states
 Article 9: frequent consultative meetings take place among member
 nations
 Article 10: treaty states will discourage activities by any country in
 Antarctica that are contrary to the treaty
 Article 11: disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties concerned
 or, ultimately, by the ICJ
 Articles 12, 13, 14: deal with upholding, interpreting, and amending
 the treaty among involved nations
 Other agreements: more than 170 recommendations adopted at treaty
 consultative meetings and ratified by governments include - Agreed
 Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (1964);
 Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972); Convention
 on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (1980); a
 mineral resources agreement was signed in 1988 but was subsequently
 rejected; in 1991 the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the
 Antarctic Treaty was signed and awaits ratification; this agreement
 provides for the protection of the Antarctic environment through five
 specific annexes on marine pollution, fauna, and flora, environmental
 impact assessments, waste management, and protected areas; it also
 prohibits all activities relating to mineral resources except
 scientific research; 14 parties have ratified Protocol as of April
 1995

 Legal system: US law, including certain criminal offenses by or
 against US nationals, such as murder, may apply to areas not under
 jurisdiction of other countries. Some US laws directly apply to
 Antarctica. For example, the Antarctic Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C.
 section 2401 et seq., provides civil and criminal penalties for the
 following activities, unless authorized by regulation of statute: The
 taking of native mammals or birds; the introduction of nonindigenous
 plants and animals; entry into specially protected or scientific
 areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and the importation
 into the US of certain items from Antarctica. Violation of the
 Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000 in fines
 and 1 year in prison. The Departments of Treasury, Commerce,
 Transportation, and Interior share enforcement responsibilities.
 Public Law 95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, requires
 expeditions from the US to Antarctica to notify, in advance, the
 Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs, Room 5801, Department of State,
 Washington, DC 20520, which reports such plans to other nations as
 required by the Antarctic Treaty. For more information contact Permit
 Office, Office of Polar Programs, National Science Foundation,

@Argentina:Economy

 Overview: Argentina, rich in natural resources, benefits also from a
 highly literate population, an export-oriented agricultural sector,
 and a diversified industrial base. Nevertheless, following decades of
 mismanagement and statist policies, the economy in the late 1980s was
 plagued with huge external debts and recurring bouts of
 hyperinflation. Elected in 1989, in the depths of recession, President
 MENEM has implemented a comprehensive economic restructuring program
 that shows signs of putting Argentina on a path of stable, sustainable
 growth. Argentina's currency has traded at par with the US dollar
 since April 1991, and inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 20
 years. Argentines have responded to the relative price stability by
 repatriating flight capital and investing in domestic industry. The
 economy registered an impressive 6% advance in 1994, fueled largely by
 inflows of foreign capital and strong domestic consumption spending.
 The government's major short term objective is encouraging exports,
 e.g., by reducing domestic costs of production. At the start of 1995,
 the government had to deal with the spillover from international
 financial movements associated with the devaluation of the Mexican
 peso. In addition, unemployment had become a serious issue for the
 government. Despite average annual 7% growth in 1991-94, unemployment
 surprisingly has doubled - due mostly to layoffs in government bureaus
 and in privatized industrial firms and utilities and, to a lesser
 degree, to illegal immigration. Much remains to be done in the 1990s
 in dismantling the old statist barriers to growth, extending the
 recent economic gains, and bringing down the rate of unemployment.

@Armenia:Economy

 Overview: Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia had
 developed a more modern industrial sector, supplying machine building
 equipment, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics
 in exchange for raw materials and energy resources. Armenia is a large
 food importer and its mineral deposits (gold, bauxite) are small. The
 economic decline in recent years (1991-94) has been particularly
 severe due to the ongoing conflict over the ethnic Armenian-dominated
 region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan and Turkey have
 blockaded pipeline and railroad traffic to Armenia for its support of
 the Karabakh Armenians. This has left Armenia with chronic energy
 shortages because of a lack of capacity and frequent disruptions of
 natural gas deliveries through unstable Georgia, as well as
 difficulties in obtaining other types of fuel. In addition, bread is
 strictly rationed and there are shortages of other goods. In 1994, the
 economy seemed to bottom out. The government has managed to increase
 its financial and budgetary discipline, bringing inflation down from
 around 40% per month in first half 1994 to single digits in second
 half 1994 and the first quarter of 1995. A full economic recovery
 cannot be expected until the conflict is settled and the blockade
 lifted.

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $8.1 billion (1994
 estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992)

 National product real growth rate: -2% (1994 est.)

 National product per capita: $2,290 (1994 est.)

 Inflation rate (consumer prices): 27% per month average (1994 est.)

 Unemployment rate: 6.5% of officially registered unemployed but large
 numbers of underemployed (1994 est.)

 Budget:

 expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA

 Exports: $43 million to countries outside the FSU (f.o.b., 1994)
 commodities: gold and jewelry, aluminum, transport equipment,
 electrical equipment

 Imports: $120 million from countries outside the FSU (c.i.f., 1994)
 commodities: grain, other foods, fuel, other energy

 External debt: $NA

 Industrial production: growth rate 7% (1994 est.); accounts for 41% of
 GDP

 Electricity:
 capacity: 4,620,000 kW
 production: 5.7 billion kWh
 consumption per capita: 1,620 kWh (1994)

 Industries: traditionally diverse, including (as a percent of output
 of former USSR) metalcutting machine tools (5.5%), forging-pressing
 machines (1.9%), electric motors (9%), tires (1.5%), knitted wear
 (4.4%), hosiery (3.0%), shoes (2.2%), silk fabric (0.8%), washing
 machines (2.0%), chemicals, trucks, watches, instruments, and
 microelectronics (1990); currently, much of industry is shut down

 Agriculture: only 17% of land area is arable; employs 31% of labor
 force as residents increasingly turn to subsistence agriculture;
 fruits (especially grapes) and vegetable farming, minor livestock
 sector; vineyards near Yerevan are famous for brandy and other
 liqueurs

 Illicit drugs: illicit cultivator of cannabis mostly for domestic
 consumption; used as a transshipment point for illicit drugs to
 Western Europe

 Economic aid:
 recipient: considerable humanitarian aid, mostly food and energy
 products, from US and EU; Russia granted 60 billion rubles in
 technical credits in late 1994 and approved a 110 billion ruble credit
 almost half of which was to go toward the restart of the Metsamor
 nuclear power plant

@Aruba:Economy

 Overview: Tourism is the mainstay of the Aruban economy, although
 offshore banking and oil refining and storage are also important. The
 rapid growth of the tourism sector over the last decade has resulted
 in a substantial expansion of other activities. Construction has
 boomed, with hotel capacity five times the 1985 level. Additionally,
 the reopening of the country's oil refinery in 1993, a major source of
 employment and foreign exchange earnings, has further spurred growth.
 Aruba's small labor force and less than 1% unemployment rate have led
 to a large number of unfilled job vacancies despite sharp rises in
 wage rates in recent years.

@Australia:Economy

 Overview: Australia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist economy,
 with a per capita GDP comparable to levels in industrialized West
 European countries. Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major
 exporter of agricultural products, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels.
 Primary products account for more than 60% of the value of total
 exports, so that, as in 1983-84, a downturn in world commodity prices
 can have a big impact on the economy. The government is pushing for
 increased exports of manufactured goods, but competition in
 international markets continues to be severe. Australia has suffered
 from the low growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD
 countries in the early 1990s. In 1992-93 the economy recovered slowly
 from the prolonged recession of 1990-91, a major restraining factor
 being weak world demand for Australia's exports. Growth picked up so
 strongly in 1994 that the government felt the need for fiscal and
 monetary tightening by yearend. Australia's GDP grew 6.4% in 1994,
 largely due to increases in industrial output and business investment.
 A severe drought in 1994 is expected to reduce the value of
 Australia's net farm production by $825 million in the twelve months
 through June 1995, but rising world commodity prices are likely to
 boost rural exports by 7.7% to $14.5 billion in 1995/96, according to
 government statistics.

@Austria:Economy

 Overview: Austria boasts a prosperous and stable market economy with a
 sizable but falling proportion of nationalized industry and with
 extensive welfare benefits. Thanks to its raw material endowment, a
 technically skilled labor force, and strong links to German industrial
 firms, Austria occupies specialized niches in European industry and
 services (tourism, banking) and produces almost enough food to feed
 itself with only 8% of the labor force in agriculture. After 11
 consecutive years of growth, the Austrian economy experienced a mild
 recession in 1993, but growth resumed in 1994. Unemployment is 4.3%
 and will likely stay at that level as companies adjust to the
 competition of EU membership beginning 1 January 1995. To prepare for
 EU membership, Austria's government has taken measures to open the
 economy by introducing a major tax reform, privatizing state-owned
 firms, and liberalizing cross-border capital movements. Problems for
 the 1990s include an aging population, the high level of industrial
 subsidies, and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budgetary
 capabilities - the deficit climbed to over 4% of GDP in 1994.

AZERBAIJAN

 Note--Azerbaijan continues to be plagued by an unresolved
 seven-year-old conflict with Armenian separatists over its
 Nagorno-Karabakh region. The Karabakh Armenians have declared
 independence and seized almost 20% of the country's territory,
 creating almost 1 million Azeri displaced persons in the process. Both
 sides have generally observed a Russian-mediated cease-fire in place
 since May 1994, and support the OSCE-mediated peace process, now
 entering its fourth year. Nevertheless, Baku and Xankandi
 (Stepanakert) remain far apart on most substantive issues from the
 placement and composition of a peacekeeping force to the enclave's
 ultimate political status, and prospects for a negotiated settlement
 remain dim.

@Azerbaijan:Geography

 Location: Southwestern Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea, between Iran
 and Russia

 Area:
 total area: 86,600 sq km
 land area: 86,100 sq km

@Azerbaijan:Economy

 Overview: Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than either
 Armenia or Georgia, the other Transcaucasian states. It resembles the
 Central Asian states in its majority nominally Muslim population, high
 structural unemployment, and low standard of living. The economy's
 most prominent products are oil, cotton, and gas. Production from the
 Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline for several years, but
 the November 1994 ratification of the $7.5 billion oil deal with a
 consortium of Western companies should generate the funds needed to
 spur future industrial development. Azerbaijan accounted for 1.5% to
 2% of the capital stock and output of the former Soviet Union.
 Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the ex-Soviet
 republics in making the transition from a command to a market economy,
 but its considerable energy resources brighten its long-term
 prospects. Baku has only recently begun making progress on economic
 reform, and old economic ties and structures have yet to be replaced.

@Bahrain:Economy

 Overview: Tiny in area, Bahrain is well-to-do in economic resources
 and per capita income. Petroleum production and processing account for
 about 80% of export receipts, 60% of government revenues, and 30% of
 GDP. Economic conditions have fluctuated with the changing fortunes of
 oil since 1985, for example, during and following the Gulf crisis of
 1990-91. With its highly developed communication and transport
 facilities Bahrain is home to numerous multinational firms with
 business in the Gulf. A large share of exports consists of petroleum
 products made from imported crude. Prospects for 1995 are good, with
 private enterprise the main driving force, e.g., in banking and
 construction. Unemployment, especially among the young, and the
 depletion of both oil and underground water resources are major
 long-term economic problems.

@Bangladesh:Economy

 Overview: Despite sustained domestic and international efforts to
 improve economic and demographic prospects, Bangladesh remains one of
 the world's poorest, most densely populated, and least developed
 nations. Its economy is overwhelmingly agricultural, with the
 cultivation of rice the single most important activity in the economy.
 Major impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, the
 inefficiency of state-owned enterprises, a rapidly growing labor force
 that cannot be absorbed by agriculture, delays in exploiting energy
 resources (natural gas), and inadequate power supplies. Excellent rice
 crops and expansion of the export garment industry led to real growth
 of 4% in 1992 and again in 1993. Policy measures intended to reduce
 government regulation of private industry, to curb population growth,
 and to expand employment opportunities have had only partial success
 given the serious nature of Bangladesh's basic problems.

@Barbados:Economy

 Overview: A per capita income of $9,200 gives Barbados one of the
 highest standards of living of all the small island states of the
 eastern Caribbean. Historically, the economy was based on the
 cultivation of sugarcane and related activities. In recent years,
 however, the economy has diversified into manufacturing and tourism. A
 moderate recovery that began in late 1993 after 3 years of contraction
 is mainly due to increased tourism and expansion in the construction
 sector. Economic prospects for 1995 depend mostly on continued growth
 in the industrialized countries, especially in Europe, which would
 spur further expansion in tourism.

@Belarus:Economy

 Overview: Belarus ranks among the most developed of the former Soviet
 states, with a relatively modern - by Soviet standards - and diverse
 machine building sector and a robust agriculture sector. It also
 serves as a transport link for Russian oil exports to the Baltic
 states and Eastern and Western Europe. The breakup of the Soviet Union
 and its command economy has resulted in a sharp economic contraction
 as traditional trade ties have collapsed. The Belarusian government
 has lagged behind the governments of most other former Soviet states
 in economic reform, with privatization almost nonexistent. The system
 of state orders and distribution persists. In mid-1994, the Belarusian
 government embarked on an austerity program with IMF support to slash
 state credits and consumer subsidies in order to bring down the budget
 deficit and reduce inflation. However, despite its promising start,
 the regime's drive to reinvigorate the economy has fallen short, and
 the IMF has criticized its failure to implement the reforms that the
 Fund had negotiated. As a result, the IMF has suspended talks on
 introducing a stand-by arrangement. Economic relations with Russia,
 which will have an important bearing on the future course of the
 economy, will be strengthened if Minsk adopts the necessary
 legislation to implement a customs union agreed to in January 1995.

@Belgium:Economy

 Overview: This small private enterprise economy has capitalized on its
 central geographic location, highly developed transport network, and
 diversified industrial and commercial base. Industry is concentrated
 mainly in the populous Flemish area in the north, although the
 government is encouraging reinvestment in the southern region of
 Walloon. With few natural resources Belgium must import substantial
 quantities of raw materials and export a large volume of manufactures,
 making its economy unusually dependent on the state of world markets.
 Three-fourths of its trade is with other EU countries. The economy
 grew at a strong 4% pace during the period 1988-90, slowed to 1% in
 1991-92, dropped by 1.5% in 1993, and recovered with 2.3% growth in
 1994. Belgium's public debt has risen to 140% of GDP, and the
 government is trying to control its expenditures to bring the figure
 more into line with other industrialized countries.

@Benin:Economy

 Overview: The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and dependent on
 subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade. Growth
 in real output has averaged a sound 4% in 1991-94 but this rate barely
 exceeds the rapid population growth of 3.3%. Inflation jumped to 35%
 in 1994 (compared to 3% in 1993) following the 50% currency
 devaluation in January. Commercial and transport activities, which
 make up almost 36% of GDP, are extremely vulnerable to developments in
 Nigeria as evidenced by decreased reexport trade in 1994 due to a
 severe contraction in Nigerian demand. The industrial sector accounts
 for less than 10% of GDP and mainly produces foods, beverages, cement,
 and textiles. Support by the Paris Club and official bilateral
 creditors has eased the external debt situation in recent years. The
 government, still burdened with money-losing state enterprises and a
 bloated civil service, is gradually implementing a World Bank
 supported structural adjustment program.

@Bhutan:Economy

 Overview: The economy, one of the world's least developed, is based on
 agriculture and forestry, which provide the main livelihood for 90% of
 the population and account for about half of GDP. Agriculture consists
 largely of subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Rugged mountains
 dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other
 infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy is closely aligned
 with India's through strong trade and monetary links. The industrial
 sector is small and technologically backward, with most production of
 the cottage industry type. Most development projects, such as road
 construction, rely on Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's hydropower
 potential and its attraction for tourists are key resources; however,
 the government limits the number of tourists to 4,000 per year to
 minimize foreign influence. Much of the impetus for growth has come
 from large public-sector companies. Nevertheless, in recent years,
 Bhutan has shifted toward decentralized development planning and
 greater private initiative. The government privatized several large
 public-sector firms, is revamping its trade regime and liberalizing
 administerial procedures over industrial licensing. The government's
 industrial contribution to GDP decreased from 13% in 1988 to about 11%
 in 1993.

@Bolivia:Economy

 Overview: With its long history of semifeudal social controls,
 dependence on volatile prices for its mineral exports, and bouts of
 hyperinflation, Bolivia has remained one of the poorest and least
 developed Latin American countries. However, Bolivia has experienced
 generally improving economic conditions since the PAZ Estenssoro
 administration (1985-89) introduced market-oriented policies which
 reduced inflation from 11,700% in 1985 to about 20% in 1988. PAZ
 Estenssoro was followed as President by Jaime PAZ Zamora (1989-93) who
 continued the free-market policies of his predecessor, despite
 opposition from his own party and from Bolivia's once powerful labor
 movement. By maintaining fiscal discipline, PAZ Zamora helped reduce
 inflation to 9.3% in 1993, while GDP grew by an annual average of
 3.25% during his tenure. Inaugurated in August 1993, President SANCHEZ
 DE LOZADA has vowed to advance the market-oriented economic reforms he
 helped launch as PAZ Estenssoro's planning minister. His successes so
 far have included an inflation rate that continues to decrease - the
 1994 rate of 8.5% was the lowest in ten years - the signing of a free
 trade agreement with Mexico, and progress on his unique privatization
 plan. The main privatization bill was passed by the Bolivian
 legislature in late March 1994. Related laws - one that establishes
 SIRESE, the regulatory agency that will oversee the privatizations,
 and another that outlines the rules for privatization in the
 electricity sector - were approved later in the year.

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

 Note--Bosnia and Herzegovina is set to enter its third year of
 interethnic civil strife which began in the spring of 1992 after the
 Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina held a referendum on
 independence. Bosnia's Serbs - supported by neighboring Serbia -
 responded with armed resistance aimed at partitioning the republic
 along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held areas to 'greater Serbia'. In
 March 1994, Bosnia's Muslims and Croats reduced the number of warring
 factions from three to two by signing an agreement in Washington, DC,
 creating the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A group of rebel
 Muslims, however, continues to battle government forces in the
 northwest enclave of Bihac. A Contact Group of countries, the US, UK,
 France, Germany, and Russia, continues to seek a resolution between
 the Federation and the Bosnian Serbs. In July of 1994 the Contact
 Group presented a plan to the warring parties that roughly equally
 divides the country between the two, while maintaining Bosnia in its
 current internationally recognized borders. The Federation agreed to
 the plan almost immediately, while the Bosnian Serbs rejected it.

@Bosnia And Herzegovina:Economy

 Overview: Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The Former Yugoslav
 Republic of Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old Yugoslav
 federation. Although agriculture has been almost all in private hands,
 farms have been small and inefficient, and the republic traditionally
 has been a net importer of food. Industry has been greatly
 overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of Communist central
 planning and management. TITO had pushed the development of military
 industries in the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large
 share of Yugoslavia's defense plants. As of February 1995, Bosnia and
 Herzegovina was being torn apart by the continued bitter interethnic
 warfare that has caused production to plummet, unemployment and
 inflation to soar, and human misery to multiply. No economic
 statistics for 1992-94 are available, although output clearly has
 fallen substantially below the levels of earlier years and almost
 certainly is well below $1,000 per head. The country receives
 substantial amounts of humanitarian aid from the international
 community.

 of the population but supplies only about 50% of food needs and
 accounts for only 5% of GDP. Subsistence farming and cattle raising
 predominate. The driving force behind the rapid economic growth of the
 1970s and 1980s has been the mining industry. This sector, mostly on
 the strength of diamonds, has gone from generating 25% of GDP in 1980
 to 39% in 1994. No other sector has experienced such growth,
 especially not agriculture, which is plagued by erratic rainfall and
 poor soils. The unemployment rate remains a problem at 25%. Hampered
 by a still sluggish diamond market in 1994, GDP grew by only 1%.

@Brazil:Economy

 Overview: The economy, with large agrarian, mining, and manufacturing
 sectors, entered the 1990s with declining real growth, runaway
 inflation, an unserviceable foreign debt of $122 billion, and a lack
 of policy direction. In addition, the economy remained highly
 regulated, inward-looking, and protected by substantial trade and
 investment barriers. Ownership of major industrial and mining
 facilities is divided among private interests - including several
 multinationals - and the government. Most large agricultural holdings
 are private, with the government channeling financing to this sector.
 Conflicts between large landholders and landless peasants have
 produced intermittent violence. The COLLOR government, which assumed
 office in March 1990, launched an ambitious reform program that sought
 to modernize and reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices,
 deregulating the economy, and opening it to increased foreign
 competition. Itamar FRANCO, who assumed the presidency following
 President COLLOR's resignation in December 1992, was out of step with
 COLLOR's reform agenda; initiatives to redress fiscal problems,
 privatize state enterprises, and liberalize trade and investment
 policies lost momentum. Galloping inflation - by June 1994 the monthly
 rate had risen to nearly 50% - had undermined economic stability. In
 response, the then finance minister, Fernando Henrique CARDOSO,
 launched the third phase of his stabilization plan, known as Plano
 Real, that called for a new currency, the real, which was introduced
 on 1 July 1994. Inflation subsequently dropped to under 3% per month
 through the end of 1994. The newly elected President CARDOSO has
 called for the implementation of sweeping market-oriented reform,
 including public sector and fiscal reform, privatization,
 deregulation, and elimination of barriers to increased foreign
 investment. Brazil's natural resources remain a major, long-term
 economic strength.

@British Virgin Islands:Economy

 Overview: The economy, one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean
 area, is highly dependent on the tourist industry, which generates
 about 21% of the national income. In 1985 the government offered
 offshore registration to companies wishing to incorporate in the
 islands, and, in consequence, incorporation fees generated about $2
 million in 1987. The economy slowed in 1991 because of the poor
 performances of the tourist sector and tight commercial bank credit.
 Livestock raising is the most significant agricultural activity. The
 islands' crops, limited by poor soils, are unable to meet food
 requirements.

@Bulgaria:Economy

 Overview: The Bulgarian economy continued its painful adjustment in
 1994 from the misdirected development undertaken during four decades
 of Communist rule. Many aspects of a market economy have been put in
 place and have begun to function, but much of the economy, especially
 the industrial sector, has yet to re-establish market links lost with
 the collapse of the other centrally planned Soviet Bloc economies. The
 prices of many imported industrial inputs, especially energy products,
 have risen markedly, and falling real wages have not sufficed to
 restore competitiveness. The government plans more extensive
 privatization in 1995 to improve the management of enterprises and to
 encourage foreign investment. Bulgaria resumed payments on its $10
 billion in commercial debt in 1993 following the negotiation of a 50%
 write-off.

@Burkina:Economy

 Overview: One of the poorest countries in the world, Burkina has a
 high population density and a high population growth rate, few natural
 resources, and a fragile soil. Economic development is hindered by a
 poor communications network within a landlocked country. Agriculture
 provides about 40% of GDP and is mainly of a subsistence nature.
 Industry, dominated by unprofitable government-controlled
 corporations, accounts for about 15% of GDP. Following the 50%
 currency devaluation in January 1994, the government updated its
 development program in conjunction with international agencies. Even
 with the best of plans, however, the government faces formidable
 problems on all sides.

@Burma:Economy

 Overview: Burma has a mixed economy with about 75% private activity,
 mainly in agriculture, light industry, and transport, and with about
 25% state-controlled activity, mainly in energy, heavy industry, and
 foreign trade. Government policy in the last six years, 1989-94, has
 aimed at revitalizing the economy after four decades of tight central
 planning. Thus, private activity has markedly increased; foreign
 investment has been encouraged, so far with moderate success; and
 efforts continue to increase the efficiency of state enterprises.
 Published estimates of Burma's foreign trade are greatly understated
 because of the volume of black market trade. A major ongoing problem
 is the failure to achieve monetary and fiscal stability. Although
 Burma remains a poor Asian country, its rich resources furnish the
 potential for substantial long-term increases in income, exports, and
 living standards.

@Burundi:Economy

 Overview: A landlocked, resource-poor country in an early stage of
 economic development, Burundi since October 1993 has suffered from
 massive ethnic-based violence that has displaced an estimated million
 people, disrupted production, and set back needed reform programs.
 Burundi is predominately agricultural with roughly 90% of the
 population dependent on subsistence agriculture. Its economic health
 depends on the coffee crop, which accounts for 80% of foreign exchange
 earnings. The ability to pay for imports therefore continues to rest
 largely on the vagaries of the climate and the international coffee
 market. As part of its economic reform agenda, launched in February
 1991 with IMF and World Bank support, Burundi is trying to diversify
 its agricultural exports, attract foreign investment in industry, and
 modernize government budgetary practices. Although the government
 remains committed to reforms, it fears new austerity measures would
 add to ethnic tensions.

@Cambodia:Economy

 Overview: The Cambodian economy - virtually destroyed by decades of
 war - is slowly recovering. Government leaders are moving toward
 restoring fiscal and monetary discipline and have established good
 working relations with international financial institutions. Growth,
 starting from a low base, has been strong in 1991-94. Despite such
 positive developments, the reconstruction effort faces many tough
 challenges because of the persistence of internal political divisions
 and the related lack of confidence of foreign investors. Rural
 Cambodia, where 90% of about 9.5 million Khmer live, remains mired in
 poverty. The almost total lack of basic infrastructure in the
 countryside will hinder development and will contribute to a growing
 imbalance in growth between urban and rural areas over the near term.
 Moreover, the government's lack of experience in administering
 economic and technical assistance programs and rampant corruption
 among officials will slow the growth of critical public sector
 investment. Inflation for 1994 as a whole was less than a quarter of
 the 1992 rate and was declining during the year.

@Cameroon:Economy

 Overview: Because of its offshore oil resources and favorable
 agricultural conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed, most
 diversified primary commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still,
 it faces many of the serious problems facing other underdeveloped
 countries, such as political instability, a top-heavy civil service,
 and a generally unfavorable climate for business enterprise. The
 development of the oil sector led rapid economic growth between 1970
 and 1985. Growth came to an abrupt halt in 1986, precipitated by steep
 declines in the prices of major exports: coffee, cocoa, and petroleum.
 Export earnings were cut by almost one-third, and inefficiencies in
 fiscal management were exposed. In 1990-93, with support from the IMF
 and World Bank, the government began to introduce reforms designed to
 spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, and
 recapitalize the nation's banks. Political instability, following
 suspect elections in 1992, brought IMF/WB structural adjustment to a
 halt. Although the 50% devaluation of the currency in January 1994
 improved the potential for export growth, mismanagement remains and is
 the main barrier to economic improvement.

@Canada:Economy

 Overview: As an affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada today
 closely resembles the US in per capita output, market-oriented
 economic system, and pattern of production. Since World War II the
 impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors
 has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one
 primarily industrial and urban. In the 1980s, Canada registered one of
 the highest rates of real growth among the OECD nations, averaging
 about 3.2%. With its great natural resources, skilled labor force, and
 modern capital plant, Canada has excellent economic prospects,
 although the country still faces high unemployment and a growing debt.
 Moreover, the continuing constitutional impasse between English- and
 French-speaking areas has observers discussing a possible split in the
 confederation; foreign investors have become edgy.

@Cape Verde:Economy

 Overview: Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor natural
 resource base, serious water shortages exacerbated by cycles of
 long-term drought, and a high birthrate. The economy is service
 oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services accounting for
 60% of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural
 areas, agriculture's share of GDP is only 20%; the fishing sector
 accounts for 4%. About 90% of food must be imported. The fishing
 potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. Cape Verde
 annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by remittances from
 emigrants and foreign aid, which form important supplements to GDP.
 Economic reforms, launched by the new democratic government in 1991,
 are aimed at developing the private sector and attracting foreign
 investment to diversify the economy. Prospects for 1995 depend heavily
 on the maintenance of aid flows, remittances, and the momentum of the
 government's development program.

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $410 million (1993

 Agriculture: accounts for 20% of GDP (including fishing); largely
 subsistence farming; bananas are the only export crop; other crops -
 corn, beans, sweet potatoes, coffee; growth potential of agricultural
 sector limited by poor soils and scanty rainfall; annual food imports
 required; fish catch provides for both domestic consumption and small
 exports

@Central African Republic:Economy

 Overview: Subsistence agriculture, together with forestry, remains the
 backbone of the CAR economy, with more than 70% of the population
 living in outlying areas. The agricultural sector generates about half
 of GDP. Timber has accounted for about 26% of export earnings and the
 diamond industry for 54%. Important constraints to economic
 development include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor
 transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a legacy of
 misdirected macroeconomic policies. A major plus is the large forest
 reserves, which the government is moving to protect from
 overexploitation. The 50% devaluation of the currencies of 14
 Francophone African nations on 12 January 1994 had mixed effects on
 CAR's economy. While diamond, timber, coffee, and cotton exports
 increased - leading GDP to increase by 5.5% - inflation rose to 40%,
 fueled by the rising prices of imports on which the economy depends.
 CAR's poor resource base and primitive infrastructure will keep it
 dependent on multilateral donors and France for the foreseeable
 future.

@Chad:Economy

 Overview: Climate, geographic remoteness, poor resource endowment, and
 lack of infrastructure make Chad one of the most underdeveloped
 countries in the world. Its economy is hobbled by political turmoil,
 conflict with Libya, drought, and food shortages. Consequently the
 economy has shown little progress in recent years in overcoming a
 severe setback brought on by civil war in the late 1980s. More than
 80% of the work force is involved in subsistence farming and fishing.
 Cotton is the major cash crop, accounting for at least half of
 exports. Chad is highly dependent on foreign aid, especially food
 credits, given chronic shortages in several regions. Of all the
 Francophone countries in Africa, Chad has benefited the least from the
 50% devaluation of their currencies on 12 January 1994. Despite an
 increase in external financial aid and favorable price increases for
 cotton - the primary source of foreign exchange - the corrupt and
 enfeebled government bureaucracy continues to dampen economic
 enterprise by neglecting payments to domestic suppliers and public
 sector salaries. Oil production in the Lake Chad area remains a
 distant prospect and the subsistence-driven economy probably will
 continue to limp along in the near term.

@Chile:Economy

 Overview: Chile has a prosperous, essentially free market economy,
 with the degree of government intervention varying according to the
 philosophy of the different regimes. Under the center-left government
 of President AYLWIN, which took power in March 1990, spending on
 social welfare rose steadily. At the same time business investment,
 exports, and consumer spending also grew substantially. The new
 president, FREI, who took office in March 1994, has emphasized social
 spending even more. Growth in 1991-94 has averaged 6.5% annually, with
 an estimated one million Chileans having moved out of poverty in the
 last four years. Copper remains vital to the health of the economy;
 Chile is the world's largest producer and exporter of copper. Success
 in meeting the government's goal of sustained annual growth of 5%
 depends on world copper prices, the level of confidence of foreign
 investors and creditors, and the government's own ability to maintain
 a conservative fiscal stance.
